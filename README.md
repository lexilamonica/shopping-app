# shopping-app
This project was for understanding software testing. Within this porject, all of the production code was provided. My task was to (1) add tests and other testing artifacts to this project and (2) document observations about the project. I provided the following test:
    ― Normal Boundary tests for the total cost calculation function
    ― Equivalence partitioning tests of total cost calculation function
    ― Unit tests using mocks, of the database interface
As for the coverage that I provided for this project, I am pleased to say that I was able to get 80% for my overall branch coverage. I was able to make 100% for branches on TaxCalculator and TotalCostCalculator. I was able to get to 75% on PuchaseAgent. While, making 50% for ShoppingCart. Therefore, I wasn’t able to test branches on the rest of the elements in the package.
